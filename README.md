# Bio-Inspired-Artificial-Intelligence-Project
Project developed for the Bio-Inspired Artificial Intelligence course held by Professor Giovanni Iacca, University of Trento, AY 2024/2025.
This project implements Multi-Objective Particle Swarm Optimization (MOPSO) and the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II) to tune Random Forest hyperparameters, with the goal of simultaneously optimizing two objectives: maximizing test AUPRC and minimizing the overfitting gap. This task is particularly relevant in the context of biomedical research and in building machine learning models where the number of features greatly exceeds the number of samples.
